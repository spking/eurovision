⋅⋅* x symbol
x appears in a cell where the nation in the respective row did not participate during the year of the respective column.

⋅⋅* ✝ symbol
✝ appears above a year column where the winner of the contest that particular year doesn't coincide with the highest points awarded in the televoting system. for simplicity's sake,
we omit the jury voting system. since 2016, the voting system [changed](https://eurosong-contest.fandom.com/wiki/Voting_Systems) so that the jury's vote was presented seperately,
although the total points each county got didnt change, the jury vote seems like it presents a possible bias, evidence is possibly in the first example of this "50/50 televote jury
system", where, Russia won the most points in the televoting, but Ukraine won the contest with the jury vote included. Coincidentally, this was shortly after the Russian occupation of the Crimean
peninsula, which notoriously wasn't very popular amongst EU member states. Also seemingly by coincidence, the ukrainian song that won, was conspicuously written about the
[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_the_Crimean_Tatars), only 27 months after the russians first offensive into Crimea.
Lets just say, alot of politically motivated coincidences in what is supposed to be "to bring Europeans together".
